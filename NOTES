Hero section shows:
1.  usage of gsap in hero banner
2.  adding resize event listener properly and removing
3.  resize event listener can be used as below also
        window.addEventListener("resize",() => handleSrcEvent())
    The difference betwween this and method used in app is that this would create a tiny overhead of calling an extra
    anonymous function unnecessarily
